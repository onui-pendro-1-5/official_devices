Do you want to bring Official support for your phone? Then please read the below points 

1 - Without  phone we won't accept official support for the particular device which you want to bring Official tag

2 - you need to have the knowledge on GitHub usage

3 - well before coming here and applying for official? Just do unofficial build and mail us with screenshots and  video recording

4 - also you must have your own source codes

    Example we accept rebase trees but commits and proper authorships must and should be there

5 - you should not do any modifications in to our source code . Unless without taking our permissions
